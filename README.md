# Search-Engine-and-Recommendation-System
I engineered a content-based recommendation system that leveraged user behavior and product attributes to deliver personalized recommendations, significantly boosting customer engagement and sales.
Additionally, I developed an advanced search engine utilizing TF-IDF, word embeddings, PyTerrier, Sentence-BERT, and Deep Text Search to provide accurate and relevant product suggestions, supporting complex queries, multilingual search, and precise search results.

The dataset used contains more than 5.8 million productsthat was created by extracting data from Flipkart.com, a leading Indian eCommerce store"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/flipkart-products".
